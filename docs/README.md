# How to craft?

## [Ores](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Ore "Ore")
The amount of items you need to craft is bound to the maximum amount of drops you can get from that ore block, using a pickaxe with [Fortune](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Fortune#Ore "Fortune - Ore") III. All crafting recipes are shapeless, meaning you don't have to put the items in specific spots to craft the ore blocks.

All crafting recipes require a base block, [stone](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Stone "Stone"), [deepslate](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Deepslate "Deepslate"), or in some cases, [netherrack](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Netherrack "Netherrack").

## [Raw Metals](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_Metal "Raw Metal")
[Raw copper](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_Copper "Raw Copper"), [gold](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_Gold "Raw Gold"), and [iron](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_Iron "Raw Iron") are crafted using 4 ingots and one gravel.
